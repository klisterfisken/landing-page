# landing-page

For this Odin project I will create a landing page using the skills I've learned so far.

Update,
I will consider this project finished now, eventhough I'm not completely satisfied with the logic and flow of my syntax.

Adopting a growth mindset, however, I will still put my pencil down and hopefully I can return one day and easily spot things to improve.
